# vcpkg-registry

My [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) registry. Created mostly for experiments and is used as an example for [this article](https://decovar.dev/blog/2022/10/30/cpp-dependencies-with-vcpkg/).

Many ports are heavily based on (*or just copies of*) the ports from the [Microsoft's registry](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg).
