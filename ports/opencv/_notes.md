# Maintainer notes

## Minimal configuration

Similar to `gdal`, this project is very complex and difficult to build, mostly because of the tremendous amount of 3rd-party dependencies. So it is build in the most minimal configuration possible, where the vast majority of modules/features is disabled, and they will be getting enabled gradually based on demand.
