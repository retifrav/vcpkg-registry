To use Mesa components in your project (with SpirvToDxil as an example):

    find_package(SpirvToDxil REQUIRED) # no CONFIG here, unfortunately
    target_include_directories(main
        PRIVATE
            ${SpirvToDxil_INCLUDE_DIR}
    )
    target_link_libraries(main
        PRIVATE
            MESA::SpirvToDxil
    )
