# Maintainer notes

## It is a fork

At the moment this port is using the sources of a fork(?), while the original(?) repository seems to be <https://github.com/yixuan/spectra>. The reason is that this is a dependency of `teaserpp` port, which [refers](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/TEASER-plusplus/blob/9ca20d9b52fcb631e7f8c9e3cc55c5ba131cc4e6/cmake/spectra.CMakeLists.txt.in#L7) to this fork specifically.
