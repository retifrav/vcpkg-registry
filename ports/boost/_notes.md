## Not auto-generated with the Boost script

This port is not part of the ports auto-generated with `scripts/boost/generate-ports.ps1`. It is a Windows-only port for downloading pre-built Boost binary package. Perhaps it should be renamed to `boost-binaries` and let that script to generate the `boost` one.
